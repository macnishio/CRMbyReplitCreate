## 9. Data Validation and Error Handling

Our CRM application includes robust data validation and error handling to ensure data integrity and provide a smooth user experience.

### Lead Management
- Email Validation: The system prevents duplicate email entries for leads. If you try to create a new lead with an email that already exists in the system, you'll receive an error message.
- Input Validation: All required fields must be filled out before submitting the form. The system will highlight any missing or incorrectly formatted information.

### Opportunity Management
- Close Date Validation: When creating or editing an opportunity, the close date must be set to a future date. If you select a date in the past or today's date, you'll receive an error message.
- Amount Validation: The opportunity amount must be a positive number. Negative values or zero are not accepted.

### Error Messages
- If an error occurs during any operation (create, update, delete), you'll see a flash message at the top of the page explaining what went wrong.
- These error messages are designed to be user-friendly and provide guidance on how to correct the issue.

### Successful Operations
- When an operation is successful (e.g., creating a new lead, updating an opportunity), you'll see a success message confirming the action.

If you encounter any persistent errors or issues that you can't resolve, please contact our support team for assistance.
